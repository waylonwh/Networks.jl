# Networks.jl

Network and graph analysis toolkit allowing to handle multigraphs and self-loops.

This package was developed when I was taking a course on Complex Network Modelling and Inference at The University of Adelaide in 2025.
Further development and maintenance is not guaranteed.
Contributions are welcome.
